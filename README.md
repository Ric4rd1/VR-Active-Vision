#  🤖🌱VR-based Active Vision for Agricultural Robotics 🌱🤖

This project explores the use of **Virtual Reality (VR)** to teleoperate a **robotic arm equipped with a stereo camera**.  
The VR headset (HMD) controls the perspective of the camera mounted on the robotic arm, enabling an **active vision system**.  
The application is oriented towards **agricultural environments**, addressing challenges such as occlusion from leaves or branches, and improving **telepresence, usability, and perceptual information comprehension**.

## ⚙️ Technologies
- **Meta Quest 3** (VR headset) connected to Unity via  
  - [Meta Quest Link](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/1517439565442928/)  
  - [Meta SDK](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/downloads/package/meta-xr-sdk-all-in-one-upm/)  
- **Unity** connected to **ROS 2** using the [ROS–TCP–Connector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub). 
- **ROS2 Humble**
